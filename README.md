# pixelgame
We are going to make a game.

Update 8/17/2015:
We changed the game idea. Now there's a grid and you control a hero pixel. You're in an arena of endlessly spawning enemies and you try to survive as long as you can, killing them as they enemies get harder and earning ways to upgrade your hero.
